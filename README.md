# Raspberry Pi PenTest Toolkit

## Overview
The **Raspberry Pi PenTest Toolkit** is a powerful, web-based interface designed to leverage the capabilities of a TP-Link antenna connected to a Raspberry Pi for conducting various network penetration tests. This toolkit is built using a Flask server backend, facilitating a range of network security assessments through a user-friendly dashboard.

## Key Features
- **Network Scanning**: Scan and display available WiFi networks within the antenna's range to identify potential targets.
- **Deauthentication Attacks**: Perform controlled deauthentication attacks against specific networks to test security measures and capture WPA handshakes.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: A dynamic, hacker-style interface that allows users to execute penetration testing tasks with ease and precision.

## Technology Stack
- **Flask**: Serves as the backbone of the application, managing server-side logic and client-server communications.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Enhances the front-end presentation and interactivity, providing a responsive user experience tailored for penetration testing.
- **Python**: Drives backend operations, handling complex network scanning and attack simulations.

## Usage Guidelines
This toolkit is intended for educational purposes and ethical penetration testing only. Users must ensure compliance with local laws and obtain proper authorization before engaging in any network testing activities. The toolkit is designed to provide practical experience and insight into the fundamentals of network security.

## Setup
To get started with the Raspberry Pi PenTest Toolkit, follow these setup instructions:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pen-test-toolkit.git
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
  cd pen-test-toolkit
  pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Start the Flask server: python app.py
4. Open a web browser and access the toolkit at: http://localhost:5000 or use your Raspberry Pi's IP address if accessing from a different machine.

## Security and Ethical Considerations
This toolkit should be used with the utmost respect for privacy and security standards. Always perform tests within legal boundaries and ethical guidelines. 
Use this toolkit only on your own network or with explicit permission from the network owner.
